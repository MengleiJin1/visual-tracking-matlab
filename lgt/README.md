Local-Global Appearance Tracker
================================

This folder contains the main algoritm of the Local-Global Appearance tracker (LGT),
first presented at ICCV2011 and later extended and improved for the TPAMI journal
paper. This code is a complete re-implementation that I did for my PhD thesis and
also contains an imporoved parameter configuration that results in better results
on several modern benchmarks.
