Robust Tracking via Multiple Experts using Entropy Minimization
===============================================================

This folder includes an implementation of the tracking algorithm described in "MEEM: Robust Tracking via Multiple Experts using Entropy Minimization" by Jianming Zhang, Shugao Ma, Stan Sclaroff. The implementation is based on the [original implementation](http://cs-people.bu.edu/jmzhang/MEEM/MEEM.html) retrieved in October 2016.
